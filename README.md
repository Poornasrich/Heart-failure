# ANN

This project is based on Heart Failure Prediction Used Deep Learning Algorithms to predict the mortality rate of the patients.

It helps the hospital faculty in making the early detection of heart failure and take neccesary precautions in early stage. 
## ðŸ›  Skills

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorFlow, Keras, Sequential


## Lessons Learned

An Artificial Neural Network is an information processing technique. It works like the way human brain processes information. ANN includes a large number of connected processing units that work together to process information. They also generate meaningful results from it.

We can apply Neural network not only for classification. It can also apply for regression of continuous target attributes
